## Professor of Data Mining

My research is to make **data analysis algorithms** better and faster.

In particular, I am interested in:

- cluster analysis
- outlier detection
- indexing for similarity search
- text mining

Most of my research is available as open-source, e.g., in the [ELKI data mining toolkit](https://elki-project.github.io/)
