## Professor of Data Mining

My research is to make **data analysis algorithms** better and faster.

In particular, I am interested in:

- cluster analysis
- outlier detection
- indexing for similarity search
- text mining

Most of my research is available as open-source, e.g., in the [ELKI data mining toolkit](https://elki-project.github.io/)
and the [kmedoids Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/kmedoids) and its
Python wrapper "kmedoids" available on [pypi/pip](https://pypi.org/project/kmedoids/) and [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kmedoids).

### Open for work

In academia, you are expected to continuously apply for better positions and move on - that is the only way to advance your career.
But I am not set on staying in academia. I would like to have more time for *programming*, and less administrative work, and universities cannot offer such positions.

I am good at:
- programming since 1989 in dozens of languages (Java, Python, Rust, Perl, ...)
- helping and teaching others resolve issues and speed up their code
- teaching machine learning at a university level
- improving algorithms
- architecting Java projects with [200.000+ lines of code](https://www.openhub.net/p/elki/analyses/latest/languages_summary)
- optimization and refactoring (my Java refactoring work were even analyzed in scientific studies)
- Python, Rust: experienced enough to publish the packages mentioned above and to [contribute fixes to scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/whats_new/v0.23.html)
- automating with scripts (shell and Python, a long time ago in Perl)
- Linux system administration (I am a member of the Debian Linux project, although not very active right now at package maintainance)

You can contact me if you have a *competitive* offer (*no* junior positions), with the following constraints:

- software development and research are my favorite, educational roles are fine (but I'd prefer less administrative work)
- Germany, open for relocation to central and well-connected cities such as Munich or Hannover, ZÃ¼rich, Luxembourg would also be okay, but moving to the US or UK is currently not an option because of family reasons. Remote is not my favorite, I am more productive at the office, but a possibility.
- *no more sales or consulting positions*, I am interested in a *senior developer* or *senior researcher* position
