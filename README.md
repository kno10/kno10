## Professor of Data Mining

My research is to make **data analysis algorithms** better and faster.

In particular, I am interested in:

- cluster analysis
- outlier detection
- indexing for similarity search
- text mining

Most of my research is available as open-source, e.g., in the [ELKI data mining toolkit](https://elki-project.github.io/)
and the [kmedoids Rust crate](https://crates.io/crates/kmedoids) and its
Python wrapper on [pypi/pip](https://pypi.org/project/kmedoids/) and [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/kmedoids).

### Open for work

In academia, you are expected to continuously apply for better positions and move on - that is the only way to advance your career.
But I am no longer set on staying in academia. I would like to have more time for *programming*, and less administrative work.

I am good at:
- programming since 1989 in dozens of languages
- reading the code of others and helping them find the bugs they've been searching for weeks
- teaching machine learning at a university level
- improving algorithms
- architecting Java projects with [200.000+ lines of code](https://www.openhub.net/p/elki/analyses/latest/languages_summary)
- optimization and refactoring (my Java refactorings were even included in scientific studies)
- Python, Rust: experienced enough to publish the packages mentioned above and to [contribute fixes to scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/whats_new/v0.23.html)
- automating with scripts (shell and Python, a long time ago in Perl)
- Linux system administration (I am a Debian Linux Developer, although not very active right now at package maintainance)

You can contact me if you have a *competitive* offer (six digits minimum), with the following constraints:

- software development and research are my favorite, educational roles are fine (but I'd prefer less administrative work)
- Germany, a relocation to central and well-connected cities such as Munich or Hannover is an option, but going to the US or UK is currently not an option for me because of family reasons. Remote is not my favorite, I am more productive at the office
- *no sales or consulting positions*, I'd prefer *not* to have a customer-facing role and I do not like buzzword bingo
